# DiscordBot

A java discord bot built using the JDA Discord Library.
I followed the [this](https://medium.com/discord-bots/making-a-basic-discord-bot-with-java-834949008c2b) tutorial to install it. 

### Planned functionality includes:
  - Spam Moderation
  - Role Management
  - Black Jack games
  - Much, much more...
